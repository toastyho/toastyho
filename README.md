👋 Hi, my name is Touseef Hossain. 

👀 I’m a recently graduated software engineer from the University of Calgary, eager to utilize my knowledge and skills towards advancing society through innovative software projects.

🌱 Even after obtaining my degree, I'm continuously studying new software-related concepts in order to expand my knowledgebase

and learn new methodologies that will aid me in designing progressive software products.

💞️ I’m looking for opportunities that will allow me to gain software-related work experience in order to learn concepts that could only be obtained through said experience.
